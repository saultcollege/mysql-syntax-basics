# MySQL Syntax Basics

## Introduction

This site contains syntax diagrams for various basic MySQL commands with the goal of presenting a reasonable amount of information for beginners without drowning in details.  It is **not** an exhaustive reference for MySQL.  If you are not afraid of drowning, you can refer to the [MySQL reference documents](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/) for more detailed and exhaustive information.
