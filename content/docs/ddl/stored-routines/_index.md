# Stored Routines

Stored routines include [stored procedures]({{< ref "stored-procedures" >}}), user defined functions, and triggers.  Each of these objects is a stored entity in the database, and can be used to add functionality and indirection to database code.  Stored routines may involve [compound statements]({{< ref "compound-statements" >}}).
